### Readme

This is a repository I'm using to teach myself dash. 
I'm starting out mostly by going through the [tutorial](
https://dash.plotly.com/installation
) and seeing what's useful but I've also done some 
modifications like using the structure described [here](
https://dash.plotly.com/urls
) under 'Structuring a Multi-Page App' in order to reduce
boilerplate.
